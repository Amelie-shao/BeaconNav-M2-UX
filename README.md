Milestone 2: Prototype, Evaluation, and Recommendations  


# Overview
BeaconNav is a user-centred indoor navigation prototype designed for AUT’s WG building.  
It helps students locate classrooms quickly by integrating timetables, accessibility settings, and offline maps.  
This repository contains only UI/UX design artefacts and evaluation evidence — no source code.


# Prototype Screenshots
Below are the key prototype interfaces designed in Figma and implemented for demonstration:

- `Figure1_Home.png` — “Next Class” one-tap navigation  
- `Figure2_Search.png` — Unified course/room search  
- `Figure3_Favorites.png` — Saved classroom list  
- `Figure4_Route.png` — Turn-by-turn navigation with offline mode  
- `Figure5_Accessibility Mode.png` — Stair-free path toggle  
- `Figure6_Settings.png` — Offline maps and accessibility preferences  
- `Figure7_My Favorites.png` — View and manage saved rooms  
- `Figure8_Remove favorites.png` — Delete saved rooms  
- `Figure9_download Offline Maps.png` — Download campus map for offline use  
- `Figure10_My Schedule.png` — Integrated weekly timetable  
- `Figure11_BLE Ready.png` — BLE connection and readiness indicator
